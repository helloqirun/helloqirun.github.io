<DT><b>Course Objectives</b>: 
<DD> The notion of an algorithm is fundamental to all of computer science. 
In this course, we study methods for designing efficient algorithms, 
evaluating their performance, and ways of establishing precise limits on the
possible effectiveness of classes of algorithms. 

<p>
<DT> <b> Textbook and lecture notes</b>: 
   <ul> 
   <li> Textbook: 
     <i><b>Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)</b></i> 
    by T. Cormen, C. Leiserson, R. Rivest and C. Stein, 
    MIT Press, 2009 
   <li> Updated lecture notes will be posted on 
        this site. 
   </ul> 

<p> 

<p>
<DT><b>Course Outline</b>
<ol>
<li> Introduction and foundations (Ch.1-3) 
<li> Algorithm design paradigms: 
     <ul> 
     <li> Divide-and-conquer (Ch.4) 
     <li> Dynamic programming  (Ch.15)
     <li> Greedy algorithms (Ch.16)
     </ul> 
<li> Algorithms on graphs and trees (Ch.22-25)
<li> NP-completeness and approximate algorithms (Ch.34-35) 
</ol>

<p>
<DT><b>Homework Assignments</b>: 
<ul> 
<li> There will be four homework assignments. 
     <i> The material in this class can only be learned by doing
     lots of problems, so the homework is very important. </i> 
<li> Your homework should be your own work. It is a matter of
     intellectual honesty to write your homework strictly by yourself. 
     Using solutions from any other source is not allowed.   
<li> Homework assignments are to be turned in at  <a href="https://gradescope.com/" target="_blank">gradescope</a>.
<li> <font color="red">
     <i>No late homework will be accepted! No email homework!</i>
     </font>
</ul> 

<p>
<DT><b>Exams (tentative)</b><i> (All exams are closed-book, no notes allowed)</i>:  
<ul>

<li> Final: September 15
</ul> 

<p>
<DT><b>Grading</b>: 
<DD> Grading breakdown:
<ul> 
<li> Homeworks: 40%
<li> Midterm exam: 30%
<li> Final exam: 30%
</ul> 
<DD> Grading may reflect the clarity of your presentation as well as the
