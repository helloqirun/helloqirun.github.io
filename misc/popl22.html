		<h1>[POPL'22 Tutorial] Program Analysis via Graph Reachability: Past, Present, and Future</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Many program-analysis problems can be formulated as a formal-language
	reachability (L-reachability) problem. In the literature, the best-known
	L-reachability problem is context-free language reachability
	(CFL-reachability). Specifically, the CFLs can be used to capture
	well-balanced program properties, such as field accesses (i.e., reads
	and writes), pointer indirections (i.e., references and dereferences),
	and context-sensitivity (i.e., function calls and returns). The purpose
	of this tutorial is to provide an overview of various graph-reachability
	frameworks, discuss recent algorithmic and complexity developments, and
	teach participants how to design efficient program analyses based on
	graph reachability. The first part of the tutorial will provide
	background on program analysis via graph reachability, focusing on the
	origin, fundamentals, and practical development of CFL-reachability. The
	second part of the tutorial will cover recent developments that extend
	CFL-reachability. We will focus on discussing asymptotically faster
	algorithms for Dyck-reachability and frameworks that are more expressive
	than CFL-reachability.</p>
