		<h1>REU positions for program analysis</h1>

	<hr>
	<h2>Description</h2>


<p>
The goal of this research is to develop a precise and scalable framework for
	static analysis. The research formulates the analysis problems as graph
	reachability problems based on linear conjunctive language reachability
	(LCL-reachability). We have two planed directions: (1) automatic
	average-case analysis of LCL-reachability algorithms; (2) providing
	extensible supports for debugger testing.</p>

<p>
The REU students will be working with my PhD students to get hands-on experience
	in the exciting research in program analysis. Moreover, the REU students
	will also be invited to the bi-weekly PLSE meetings at the School of
	Computer Science, where they can share the project outcomes with the
	PLSE audience at Georgia Tech. In the COVID-19 pandemic, we will move
	all meetings online. In-person meetings are not required.</p>

<p>You might find more information about my research at
	<a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~qrzhang/">https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~qrzhang/</a>. Please feel free to reach out to me
	if you have any questions. Two publications related to the project:

<ol>
  <li>Fast Graph Simplification for Interleaved Dyck-Reachability (<a href="projects/interdyck/interdyck.html">link</a>).
</li>
  <li>Context-Sensitive Data-Dependence Analysis via Linear Conjunctive Language
	Reachability (<a href="papers/popl2017_qirun.pdf">link</a>).</li>
</ol>
</p>


	<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The positions are mainly for senior students. We accept exceptional
  junior students if we see a strong fit. The students should have taken
  upper-level computer science courses related to compilers, programming
  languages, graph theory, analysis of algorithms, formal language theory.</li>
<li>The REU project is funded by NSF. The participated students will be paid
  with stipends.</li>
<li>Applicants should have strong technical communication skills. Students are
  expected to write a technical report (or a conference paper) based on the REU
  project results.</li>
<li>Applicants must be citizens or permanent residents of the United
  States.</li>
<li>Applicants from underrepresented minorities are strongly encouraged to
  apply.</li>
<li>To apply, please check the two publications and send me an email with your
  transcript and cv. My email is qrzhang@gatech.edu.</li>
